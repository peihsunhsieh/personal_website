<p>I am a doctoral student at Stony Brook University in the <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/polsci/">department of political science</a>. I use behavioral game theory, experimental social science, agent-based computational modeling, and causal inference methods to study fairness and social preferences, information updating, and public opinion. I focus on determining how a personâ€™s beliefs about how others will and should behave, shape decisions in different contexts like redistribution cooperation, and political behaviors. I am also the lab manger of the <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/cbpe/">Center for Behavioral Political Economy</a> at Stony Brook University.</p>

This file is left intentionally empty by default to be backward compatible with initial theme setup.

Although the theme has advanced a little bit and it now allows to specify the content on the main page (even if the list of posts/articles is not intended).
This can be:
- with the list of posts/articles (default: `mainSections = ["post"]) or
- without the list of posts/articles (by setting `mainSections = [""]`)

Markdown supported, ie:

```
